Let me solve: 12 × 6 + 3 - 4 ÷ 2

Following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):
1. First, perform multiplication and division from left to      
right:
   - 12 × 6 = 72
   - 4 ÷ 2 = 2

2. Now the expression becomes: 72 + 3 - 2

3. Perform addition and subtraction from left to right:
   - 72 + 3 = 75
   - 75 - 2 = 73

**Answer: 73**
